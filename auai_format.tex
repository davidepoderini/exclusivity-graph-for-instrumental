\begin{abstract}
Instrumental variables allow the estimation of cause and effect relations even
in presence of unobserved latent factors, thus providing a powerful tool for any
science wherein causal inference plays an important role. More recently, the
instrumental scenario has also attracted increasing attention in quantum
physics, since it is related to the seminal Bell's theorem and in fact allows
the detection of even stronger quantum effects, thus enhancing our current
capabilities to process information and becoming a valuable tool in quantum
cryptography. In this work, we further explore this bridge between causality and
quantum theory and apply a technique, originally developed in the field of
quantum foundations, to express the constraints implied by causal relations in
the language of graph theory. This new approach can be applied to any causal
model containing a latent variable. Here, by focusing on the instrumental
scenario, it allows us to easily reproduce known results as well as obtain new
ones and gain new insights on the connections and differences between the
instrumental and the Bell scenarios.

\section{Introduction}
Inferring  whether a variable $A$ is the cause of another variable $B$ is at the
core of causal inference. However, unless interventions are available
\cite{pearlbook}, one can cannot exclude that observed correlations between $A$
and $B$ are due to a latent common factor, thus hindering any causal
conclusions. To cope with that, instrumental variables (IV) have been introduced
\cite{pearl1995, bonet2001}. Under the assumption that they are independent of
any latent common factors $\Lambda$, IV can be used to put non-trivial bounds on the
causal effect between $A$ and $B$.However, first, one has to guarantee that
an appropriate instrument (fulfilling a set of causal constraints) has been
employed, which is precisely the goal of the so-called instrumental tests
\cite{pearl1995, bonet2001,Ramsahai2012,Kedagni2017}. Their violation, at least in classical physics, is
an unambiguous proof that some of the causal assumptions underlying the
instrumental causal structure are not fulfilled, that is, one should identify
and use another instrumental variable.

\textcolor{red}{Instrumental tests have been introduced in econometrics \cite{Wooldridge2015}} and further explored by Pearl \cite{pearl1995}, in the form of inequalities providing a necessary condition for a given observed
probability distribution to be compatible with the instrumental causal
structure. Following that, Bonet \cite{bonet2001} introduced a general
framework \textcolor{red}{also followed in \cite{Ramsahai2012}}, showing that the instrumental correlations define a polytope, a
convex set from which the non-trivial boundaries are precisely the instrumental
inequalities. Bonet's framework allows for the derivation of new inequalities
as well as proving general results, for instance, the fact that if variable $A$
is continuous, no instrumental test exists. However, two main drawbacks arise. First, the systematic derivation of new inequalities quickly becomes
unfeasible as the variables' cardinalities increase. Second, as recently shown,
in quantum physics, violations of the instrumental tests are possible even
though the whole process is indeed subjected to an instrumental causal structure
\cite{chaves2018, himbeeck2018}. In the quantum case, instrumentality violations
witness the presence of quantum entanglement as the latent factor and prove a
stronger form of quantum non-locality compared to the famous Bell's theorem
\cite{chaves2018}. As a consequence, typical bounds on the causal influence of
$A$ into $B$ have to be reevaluated and reinterpreted in the presence of quantum
effects.

Our aim in this paper is to provide a novel and complementary framework to the
analysis of instrumental tests, which also addresses the two drawbacks mentioned
above. The proposed method is based on a graph theoretical approach introduced
in the foundations of quantum physics to analyze the possible correlations
obtained in quantum experiments \cite{cabello2014,rabelo2014}. This method allow us to reproduce the classical results by Bonet and to straightforwardly generalize them in the quantum scenario. It also offers an easy and general way -- valid for any causal scenario involving a single latent variable-- to check for the incompatibility between the
quantum and classical descriptions.

The paper is organized as follows: first we provide the necessary background for our work, describing the instrumental and Bell scenarios from both classical and quantum perspectives and introducing the exclusivity graph approach. We then show the versatily of our framework by rederiving and generalizing known results in the literature, obtaining new instrumental inequalities that hardly could be found by standard means and offering new insights about the similarities and differences between instrumental and Bell inequalities.

\section{Instrumental variables, estimation of causal influences and a new form of quantum non-locality}

\textcolor{red}{We} represent causal relations via directed acyclic graphs
(DAG), where the nodes represent random variables interconnected by directed
edges (arrows) accounting for their cause and effect relations \cite{pearlbook}.
A set of variables  $\left( X_1,\dots, X_n \right)$ form a Bayesian network with
respect to the graph if every variable $X_i$ can be expressed as a function of
its parents $PA_i$ and potentially an unobserved noise term $U_i$, such that
$U_i$ are jointly independent. This implies that the probability distribution of
such variables should have a Markov decomposition 
\footnote{Uppercase letters label variables and lowercase label the values taken
by them, for instance, $p(X_i =x_i, X_j = x_j) \equiv p(x_i, x_j)$.}
\begin{equation}
p(x_1,\dots,x_n)= \prod_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i \vert pa_i).    
\end{equation}
Importantly, a DAG typically implies non-trivial constraints over the
probability distributions that are compatible with it. That is, simply from
observational data and without the need of interventions, one can test whether
some observed correlations are incompatible with some causal hypotheses.

Within this context, an important DAG is that corresponding to the instrumental
scenario (see Fig.\ref{fig:chshinstdag}-a). Following the Markov decomposition, any
empirical data encoded in the probability distribution $p(a,b \vert x)$ and
compatible with the instrumental causal structure can be decomposed as
\begin{equation}
p(a,b \vert x) = \sum_{\lambda} p(a\vert x,\lambda) p(b\vert a,\lambda)p(\lambda).
\end{equation}
Two causal assumptions are employed to arrive to the above decomposition. First,
the assumption that
\textcolor{red}{
\begin{equation}
p(x,\lambda)=p(x)p(\lambda), 
\end{equation}}
which implies the independence of
the instrument and the common ancestor. Second, the assumption that, even though
$X$ and $B$ can be correlated, all these correlations are mediated by $A$. In
other terms, there is no direct causal influence between $X$ and $B$ and
\textcolor{red}{
\begin{equation}
p(b\vert x,a,\lambda)=p(b\vert a,\lambda).
\end{equation}}

The instrumental variables have been originally introduced to estimate parameters
in econometric models of supply and demand \cite{economic} and, since then, have found a
wide range of applications in various other fields \cite{economic2, economic3}. To illustrate its
power, consider that variables $A$ and $B$ are related by a simple linear
equation, i.e. $B=\gamma A +\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ may represent a latent common
factor. By assumption, the instrumental variable $X$ should be independent of
$\Lambda$, thus implying that the causal strength can be estimated as $\gamma=
\mathrm{Cov}(X,B)/\mathrm{Cov}(X,A)$ where $\mathrm{Cov}(X,A)$ is the covariance between $X$ and $A$. Strikingly, one can
estimate the causal strength even without any information about the latent
factor $\Lambda$. More generally, and without assumptions about the functional
dependence among the variables, the empirical data encoded in the probability
distribution $p(a,b \vert x)$ can also be used to bound different quantifiers of
causality between $A$ and $B$ \cite{pearlbook,Janzing2013}.


Clearly, however, to draw any causal conclusions, first it is necessary to
certify that one has a valid instrument. This is achieved via instrumental
inequalities, first introduced by Pearl \cite{pearl1995}. If we allow the variables $X$,
$A$, $B$ to take the values in the range  $x=1,\dots,l$, $a=1,\dots,m$ and
$b=1,\dots,n$ Pearl showed that the instrumental causal structure implies \textcolor{red}{(independently of any assumption about the functional dependence among the variables)} that 
\textcolor{blue}{
\begin{equation} 
    \sum_{j=0}^{n} P(ij|k(i,j)) \le 1,
    \label{eq:pearl_ineq}
\end{equation}
for all $i \in {1,\ldots, m}$ and for all the possible functions $k(i,j)$ where $p(i,j|k) = p(a=i,b=j\vert x=k)$.
}

Extending these results, Bonet \cite{bonet2001} provided a 
general geometric framework for the derivation of instrumental inequalities.
Instrumental correlations define a convex set, a polytope described by finitely
many extremal points, or alternatively by a finite number of facets, among which, the
non-trivial are precisely the instrumental inequalities. In particular,
considering the case $(l,m,n) = (3,2,2)$, it was proven that there are two
inequivalent classes of instrumental inequalities (those not obtained from each
other by permuting the labels of \textcolor{blue}{$i,j$ and $k$}). One class corresponding
to Pearl's inequality \eqref{eq:pearl_ineq} and the other given by
\textcolor{blue}{
\begin{multline}
    P(0 0 | 0) + P(1 1 | 0) + 
    P(0 0 | 1) +\\+ P(1 0 | 1) + 
    P(0 1 | 2) \le 2.
    \label{eq:bonet_ineq}
\end{multline}
}

All these conclusions and results, however, rely on a classical
description of causal and effect relations \textcolor{red}{(implicitly)
invoking the realism assumption: the probabilities of a given
measurement have well defined values even if such measurements are not
performed. However, since Bell's theorem \cite{bell1964} we know that
this do not apply to the world governed by quantum mechanics, thus
implying that standard causal models, even if augmented with latent
variables, are not enough to explain quantum phenomena. Bell's theorem
relies on the causal structure shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:chshinstdag}-b,
similar to the instrumental one with two crucial causal differences:
i) variable $A$ has no causal influence over $B$ and ii) $B$ has
its own instrument $Y$ and thus the correlations are encoded in a
probability distribution $p(ab \vert xy)$. This has motivated the
question of whether many of the cornerstones in causal inference
have to be reevaluated or reinterpreted in the presence of quantum
effects \cite{ried2015,Costa2016,Wolfe2016}. Indeed, as recently
shown \cite{chaves2018}, violations of the instrumental tests are
possible even though the causal constraints underlying the instrumental
scenario are fulfilled. As shown in the experimental implementation
of the instrumental test \cite{chaves2018}, this is possible due to
the presence of quantum entanglement that precludes the explanation of
the data via a latent common factor. Interestingly, every probability
distribution violating the simplest possible Bell inequality, known as
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality \cite{CHSH}, can after some
post-processing also violate Bonet's inequality \cite{himbeeck2018}. As we
will see, the graph-theoretical approach will allow us a more systematic
understanding of the similarities and differences between the Bell and
instrumental scenarios.}

Altogether, this shows the necessity of a new unifying framework, not
only considering what are the classical instrumental correlations but
as well the ones achievable if the underlying latent factor might have
a quantum origin. In the following we will achieve that by proposing a
graph-theoretical approach to analyze the instrumental inequalities.

\section{The exclusivity graph approach}
The graph-theoretical approach we propose here, was initially developed for the
study of non-contextual inequalities \cite{cabello2014} as well as Bell
non-locality scenarios \cite{acin2015}. 
\textcolor{blue}{
The purpose of this method is to easily obtain constraints on the probability distribution, in the same spirit of the Pearl's
and Bonet's inequalities, for classical and quantum systems.
In this context we select a set of random variables $A_1,\ldots,A_N$, to represents 
the outcome of a measurement performed on our physical system,
and another set $X_1,\ldots,X_M$, to represent a number of settings that can be chosen by
 the experimenter, which serve the same purpose of the instrument in the IV scenario. 
}
In the exclusivity graph formalism, every possible event, i.e. every possible set of measurement
outcomes $a_1,\ldots, a_N$ corresponding to given measurement settings
$x_1,\ldots,x_M$ , is
associated to a vertex in a (undirected) graph $G = (V, E)$. 
Two vertices $u, v \in V$ are then connected by an edge $uv \in E$ if and only if they are
exclusive, i.e., if there is a measurement/instrument that can distinguish between
them. 
\textcolor{blue}{
Intuitively, two events are considered exclusive when they cannot happen simultaneously in the same run of
the experiment.
For example in the Bell scenario depicted in fig.~\ref{fig:chshinstdag} events where we get $a = 0$ or $a = 1$, while
setting $x = 0$ for both, are exclusive, since only one of them can happen in a single run of the experiment.
On the contrary events where we get for example $a = 0$ setting $x = 1$ and $a=1$ setting $x=0$ are not exclusive
because these events are not realizable in the same experiment.
In the next section we will provide a precise definition of exclusivity which will allow us to extend the concept
to a wide range of causal models.
}
Any linear constraint (like the instrumental inequalities) can be
expressed defining a linear function
\begin{equation}
    I_w(p) = \sum_{\substack{a_1,\ldots,a_n\\x_1,\ldots,x_n}}
w_{\substack{a_1,\ldots,a_n\\x_1,\ldots,x_n}} p(a_1,\ldots,a_n|x_1,\ldots,x_n)
\end{equation}
on the probabilities of possible events.  This linear function can be
embedded in an exclusivity graph by weighting the vertices in $G$ with
the $\left\{w_{\substack{a_1,\ldots,a_n\\x_1,\ldots,x_n}}\right\}$,
\textcolor{blue}{so that it can be written as a function of $G = (V,
E)$ and its weights:
\begin{equation}
    I(G,w) = \sum_{v \in V}w_v p(v)
    \label{eq:lincostG}
\end{equation}
}
Nicely, as it will be discussed below, bounds for the maximum values for $I_w(p)$ achievable in classical and quantum
physical theories can be related to two well-known graph invariants \cite{cabello2014}: the
independence number $\alpha(G, w)$ and the Lovász theta $\theta(G, w)$,
respectively. In the following, we will briefly introduce these concepts and
their interconnections, a more extensive and detailed account can be found in
\cite{cabello2014,rabelo2014,acin2015}

Consider a graph $G(V, E)$ with vertex weights $w$, and $|V| = n$ .
We call a \emph{characteristic labelling} for $U \subseteq V$ a vector $x_v \in
\{0,1\}^n$ such that $x_v = 1$ if $v \in U$ and $x_v = 0$ otherwise.

An \emph{independent set} or \emph{stable set} is a set
$S \subset V$ such that $uv \notin E$ for all $u,v \in S$.
The independence number $\alpha(G, w)$ is defined as the maximum number of
vertices (weighted with $w$) of an independent set of $G$. 
\textcolor{blue}{
 In the case of exclusivity graphs any characteristic labelling of
 a stable set, also called a \emph{stable labelling}, represents a
 possible deterministic assignment of probabilities which respects the
 exclusivity constraints, i.e. such that no exclusive events can be
 assigned probability one at the same time.
}
It is also customary to define the set $\STAB(G)$ as the convex hull of
all the characteristic labelings of stable sets:
\begin{multline} 
    \STAB(G) = \chull (\{x : \\ x \quad \text{is a stable labelling of}\quad G \})
    \label{eq:stab}
\end{multline}
\textcolor{blue}{
Since stable labellings represent all the possible deterministic strategies respecting the 
exclusivity relations, then $\STAB(G)$ effectively includes  all the possible 
probability assignments compatible with those constraints.
Now we can define the independence number as:
}
\begin{equation}
    \alpha(G,w) = \max\{w\cdot x: x \in \STAB(G)\}
    \label{eq:alphastab}
\end{equation}
From which, we can immediately see that $\alpha(G,w)$ must corresponds to the
classical bound of the inequality, since it is exactly the maximum over
the convex set defined by all the deterministic strategies respecting
the exclusivity constraints.
\textcolor{blue}{So we have, for classical models:
\begin{equation}
    I(G,w) \le \alpha(G,w)
    \label{eq:lincostG_alphabound}
\end{equation}
Moreover the bound is tight since is saturated, for example, by
any deterministic assignment corresponding to a maximal stable set.}

\textcolor{blue}{
In associating the set $STAB(G)$ with the space of the possible
probability distributions for our graph $G$, we have made the implicit
assumption that there exists a joint probability distribution for all
of our events, i.e. that even when certain settings are not chosen by
the experimenter, we can still assign (counterfactually) a value to
their probabilities.
This assumption, called \emph{realism}, which is always true for
classical systems, is not verified in general for quantum systems.
In the following we briefly introduce the probabilistic framework used
in quantum mechanics, the interested reader can refer to classic texts
such as \cite{}.
In quantum mechanics the \emph{state} of the system, which plays a
similar role as the probability distribution for classical systems,
is represented by a  vector $\Psi$ living in a given Hilbert space
$\mathcal{H}$, normalized such that $\abs{\Psi}^2 = 1$.
Likewise, every measurement is associated to a set on orthonormal base
$\{\Phi_1,\ldots,\Phi_d\}$ of the same Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, 
or equivalently by a set of projector operators on those vectors 
$E_i = \Phi_i (\Phi_i)^T$, each of which represents a possible outcome, 
and such that $E_iE_j = 0 \forall i,j$ and $\sum_i E_i = I$.
The probability associated to each outcome is then defined by the \emph{Born's rule}:
\begin{equation}
    p_i = \Psi^T E_i \Psi = \abs{\Psi \cdot \Phi_i}^2
\end{equation}
It is known that such framewoks allows for a set of proabability distribution which
is in general a superset of the classical one.
}
\textcolor{blue}{
Exclusivity relations between events (measurement outcomes) in this way
readily translate into orthogonality between projectors.
A quantum realization of an exclusivity graph $G(V,E)$ consists in 
a set projectors $E_i$ for each vertex $i \in V$, such that $E_i$ and $E_j$ are
orthogonal each time $i$ and $j$ are connected by an edge.
This corresponds to what in graph theory is known as an \emph{orthonormal labelling} of $G$. 
}
An \emph{orthonormal labelling} of dimension $d$ a map
$a_v:V \rightarrow \Real^d$ such that $a_v \cdot a_u = 0$ for all $uv \in E$ and
$|a_v|^2 = 1$, and we define the set $\TH(G)$ as:
\begin{multline}
    \TH(G) = \{x: x_v = (a_v)_1 \, \text{where $a_v$ is an} \\ \text{orthonormal labelling of $G$}\}
    \label{eq:thbody}
\end{multline}
It can be proved that this set includes all correlations permitted by quantum
theory 
\footnote{As proved in \cite{acin2015} this set corresponds to the level
$1+AB$ of the NPA (Navascués-Pironio-Acín) hierarchy \cite{npa2008}.}, 
but in general is larger as it contains correlations beyond those achievable by quantum
mechanics \cite{almostquantum2015}.
Maximizing over $\TH(G)$ gives the Lovász theta:
\begin{equation}
    \theta(G,w) = \max \{w\cdot x : x \in \TH(G)\}
    \label{eq:lovasztheta}
\end{equation}
which upper-bounds the maximum quantum value of $I(G,w)$ in equation \eqref{eq:linconstG}.

This approach provides a useful condition to check if a given graph $G$
(or any of its subgraph) admits a quantum violation. Indeed it can be
proven that $\TH(G) = \STAB(G)$ if and only if $G$ does not contain
a cycle $C_n$ with $n \ge 5$ and odd, or its complement as an induced
subgraph.
This follows directly from two graph theoretical results: the so called
``sandwich theorem''\cite{knuth,lovasz} and the ``strong perfect graph
theorem'' \cite{spgth}.
\textcolor{blue}{
The first one states that the number $\theta(G)$ is always greater or equal
the independence number of the graph $\alpha(G)$.}
\begin{equation}
    \alpha(G) \le \theta(G)
    \label{eq:sandwich_th}
\end{equation}
When equality holds in equation \eqref{eq:sandwich_th} for a graph $G$ and all its
induced subgraphs, $G$ is called \emph{perfect}.
For perfect graphs, we can exclude the existence of a quantum
violation, since $\alpha(G) = \theta(G)$.
The second theorem then gives a useful condition to check if a graph is perfect
or not. In particular it affirms that a graph $G$ is perfect if and only if it
does not contain a $n$-cycle graph with $n\ge5$ and odd or its complement as an
induced subgraph.

Besides signaling the presence of a possible quantum violation of a classical
constraint, induced cycle subgraphs are also experimentally interesting because
they give the simplest inequalities (in terms of number of probabilities to
estimate), to test this violation.

\section{Exclusivity graph method applied to causal models}
In this section we show how the techniques presented in the previous section can be employed to analyze
a broad class of causal models. Consider the DAG depicted in Fig~\ref{fig:onelambda}, with
$N$ observable variables $A_1, \ldots, A_N$ with potential causal arrows among them, $M$
instruments $X_1, \ldots, X_M$ with no incoming edges, and a single unobservable latent
variable $\Lambda$ acting as a potential common factor for all $A_i$s (but not for
the $X_j$s).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.9\columnwidth]{images/onelambda.pdf}
    \caption{Represetantion of the class of causal structures to which our
        method can be applied, which are those with $k$ observable variables, $l$
        instruments and a single latent variable.}
    \label{fig:onelambda}
\end{figure}

\textcolor{blue}{
An \emph{exclusivity} graph can be associated with such a DAG
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nodes are associated to events like $a | x$, where $a = (a_1,\ldots,a_N)$ and  $x = (x_1,\ldots,x_M)$.
    \item Two nodes $a | x $, and $a' | x'$ are linked by an edge only if one of these two condition is true:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item for all $i,j \in \{1 ,\ldots,N\}$ if $A_i\,
                \rightarrow\, A_j$ it \emph{does not} exists any function $g_{ij} : g_{ij}(a_i) = a_j
                \et g_{ij}(a'_i) = a'_j$.
            \item for all $i\in \{1,\ldots,M\}$ and $j\in \{1,\ldots,N\}$ if
                $X_i\,\rightarrow\,A_j$ it \emph{does not} exists any function $f_{ij} : f_{ij}(x_i) = a_j
                \et f_{ij}(x'_i) = a'_j$.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
}
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Nodes are associated to events like $a | x$, where $a = (a_1,\ldots,a_k)$ and  $x = (x_1,\ldots,x_l)$.
%    \item Two nodes $a | x $, and $a' | x'$ are linked by an edge if and only if

%                \et f_{ij}(x'_i) = a'_j$.
%        \end{enumerate}
%\end{itemize}
\textcolor{blue}{
For example, referring to the Bell scenario of
Fig.~\ref{fig:chshinstdag}-b any two events $a,b,x,y$ and $a',b',x',y'$
where $x = x'$ and $a\neq a'$ (or $y = y'$ and $b \neq b'$) are exclusive,
since we would need $f(x) \neq f(x')$ even if $x = x'$ (or similarly $g(y)
\neq g(y')$ when $y = y'$).
}
As we will show next, considering the particular case of the instrumental
scenario \cite{pearl1995, bonet2001}, one can apply the graph-theoretical
methods delineated before to its corresponding exclusivity graph, $G$,
and its subgraphs. This allows to obtain instrumental inequalities and
their respective quantum and classical bounds.
\textcolor{blue}{
To do that, we proceed as follows:
First we try to determine if the graph is perfect using the \emph{strong
perfect graph theorem}, i.e. looking for odd cycles and anticycles with
more than $5$ vertices among the induced subgraphs of $G$.
If the graph is perfect then we know immediately that no quantum violation
is possible, since the sandwich theorem tells us that $\alpha(G) =
\theta(G)$ (and the same is true for any other induced subgraph).
If the graph is not perfect, then we must have found some odd cycle or
anticycle $C_n$. These kind of induced subgraphs represent our minimal
candidates for a quantum violation, cause we already know that for them
$alpha(C_n) < \theta(C_n)$, in particular:
\begin{align}
    \alpha(C_n) &= \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \\
    \theta(C_n) &= n\cos(\pi/n)/(1+\cos(\pi/n))
    \label{eq:cycle_alpha_theta}
\end{align}
Any other candidate is an induced subgraph that contains one of those
cycles/anticycles.

As a first application we will restrict our attention to the instrumental
scenario in the case of dichotomic \textcolor{blue}{measurements ($n = m = 2$).
We denote the probability of having outcomes $a$ and $b$ with the
instrument assuming the value $x$ as $p(ab|x)$ with $a, b \in \mathcal{A}
= \mathcal{B} = \{0,1\}$ and $x \in \mathcal{X} = \{0,\ldots,l\}$.}
As explained above, the 
\textcolor{blue}{exclusivity graph for the instrumental scenario is obtained by
connecting two events $a,b,x$ and $a',b',x'$ with an edge if we cannot find a function
$f:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ such that:
}
\begin{equation}
    a = f(x) \quad\text{and}\quad a'=f(x')
\end{equation}
\textcolor{blue}{
or a function $g:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ such that:
}
\begin{equation}
     b = g(a) \quad\text{and}\quad b'=g(a')
    \label{eq:non_exclusivity_condition}
\end{equation}
\textcolor{blue}{Using these rules we construct the exclusivity
graphs $G_l = (V_l, E_l)$ for various $l$, some of which are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:instrumental_exgraphs}, and use the methods described
earlier to obtain the classical and quantum bounds for several
inequalities in the instrumental scenario.
}

First, consider the case $l=2$, depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:instrumental_exgraphs} top-left, for which Pearl's
inequality \eqref{eq:pearl_ineq} defines the only instrumental inequality.
It has been shown that this inequality does not have a quantum violation
\cite{henson2014}.
For that, general probabilistic Bayesian networks, including classical and
quantum causal models as particular cases, had to be introduced.
In contrast, in our method it is straightforward not only to derive the
classical bound to Pearl's inequality but also show that there is no quantum
violation of the inequality.
In the case of $l=2$ inequalities \eqref{eq:pearl_ineq} becomes:
\begin{equation}
    P(a0|x) + P(a1|x') \le 1 \forall a,x,x' \in \{0,1\} 
    \label{eq:pearl_ineq_222}
\end{equation}
which are just the classical constraint given by the exclusivity conditions
represented by the edges of the graph (see Fig.~\ref{fig:instrumental_exgraphs}).
\textcolor{blue}{
Indeed considering the trivial induced subgraphs $S_e$ formed by only two vertices
$e = (v_1, v_2) \in E_2$, we simply have $\alpha(S_e) = 1$ from which using equation
\eqref{eq:linconstG_alphabound}, we obtain contraints in \eqref{eq:pearl_ineq_222}.
}
The fact that no quantum violation is allowed follows immediately from the fact
that the corresponding  exclusivity graph (and its complement) does not contain
any odd cycle or anticycle with more than $5$ vertices, which makes it a perfect
graph, i.e. $TH(G) = STAB(G)$. This can be easily proved in the case $l=2$ for any number of
outputs $n,m$ as shown in the supplemental materials. In this way we can exclude the
presence of any quantum violation for any scenario where the instrument can only
take two possible values ($l=2$) and an arbitrary number of outputs for $A, B$.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\columnwidth]{images/instrumental_c5.pdf}
    \caption{The exclusivity graph of the bonet inequality as an induced
    subgraph of complete one of the $(l,m,n)=(3,2,2)$ instrumental
    scenario. To simplify the representation, cliques are represented
    with the bold lines in the figure.}
    \label{fig:bonetexc}
\end{figure}

Going to $l\ge3$ we see that there might be a quantum violation, since
the associated graph has as a $C_5$ cyclic graph as induced subgraph,
i.e. the pentagon depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:bonetexc}, which is exactly
the Bonet's inequality \eqref{eq:bonet_ineq}.
For $n=5$, it follows directly the
gap between the classical and quantum theories, since the classical limit is
given by $\alpha(C_5)=2$ and the quantum bound is given by $\theta(C_5)=\sqrt{5}$.

In this framework, Eq. \eqref{eq:bonet_ineq} seems analogous to the KCBS
contextual inequality \cite{kcbs2008} that refers to measurements on single
quantum systems. The difference here is that we are in a bipartite scenario and
the real quantum limit is not simply given by the quantity $\theta(C_5) =
\sqrt{5}$, which constitutes only an upper bound for the maximum achievable
quantum violation. To find a tighter bound we can apply the technique described in
\cite{rabelo2014}, and summarized in the methods sections, based on the NPA
(Navascues, Pironio, Acin) method \cite{npa2008}, in which one defines a hierarchy of
semi-definite programs to progressively compute a better upper bound for the
quantum value.
Applying it to Bonet inequality we are able obtain the known result for the
maximum quantum bound, i.e $(3+\sqrt{2})/2 \approx 2.2071$.

As shown in the Methods section below, no other odd anticycle besides
$C_5$ is present for any $l$, that is, if we increase the cardinality of the
instrumental variable. The first $7$-cycle appears as soon as we get to $n=m=3$ and $l=4$. This Bonet-like inequality for the instrumental scenario can be written as:
\begin{multline}
    P(00|2) + P(02|3) + P(00|0) + P(12|0) + \\
    + P(10|1) + P(21|1) + P(22|2) \le 3 
    \label{eq:c7_instrumental433}
\end{multline}
Applying the method cited above for this inequality gives a quantum upper bound
of $q = 3.2990$ at the second order of the NPA hierarchy, which indicates the
possibility of a quantum violation.
Similarly, numerical analisys shows that odd cycle subgraphs with higher number
of vertices appear only if we increase the number of possible settings $l$ while
also increasing $m$, so for example $9$-cycles start to appear for $l=6, m=3$ 
and $11$-cycles for $l=7, m=4$.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/gclmp_graphs.pdf}
        \caption{Exclusivity graphs for the the inequality \eqref{eq:chsh_ineq} in the Bell
        scenario (in red) and inequality \eqref{eq:422_ineq} in the instrumental
    scenario (in green).}
        \label{fig:422_exgraph}
\end{figure}

While cycles are the simplest inequalities showing quantum violation, our method
can also be employed for the analisys of different inequalities, that can be 
devised by clever choices of vertices and weights. 
For example in the instrumental scenario $(l,m,n) = (4,2,2)$ we can find by inspection the inequality 
%\textcolor{red}{Why are we showing two %inequalities? Aren't they just symmetries of each other?}:

% At first I was showing them because in the standard CHSH 16 probabilities
% appear, 8 with plus and 8 with minus sign, and these probabilities in the
% instrumental mimic the exclusivity relations of the CHSH ones, but you are
% right, is a lot cleaner to just show 8 of them. (Davide)

\begin{multline}
    P(01\vert2) + P(11\vert2) + P(10\vert3) + P(01\vert3) + \\
     + P(00\vert0) + P(10\vert0) + P(11\vert1) + P(00\vert1) \le 3
    \label{eq:422_ineq}
\end{multline}
This inequality is interesting, since it is represented by the same exclusivity graph of the notorious CHSH inequality \cite{CHSH} for the Bell scenario (see Fig.~\ref{fig:422_exgraph}): 
%\textcolor{red}{I'm very confused about these %inequalities... it seems like
%Alice has four %measurement settings... the inequali should be %something like
%$P(00\vert 00) + P(11 \vert 00) + %P(00\vert 01) + P(11 \vert 01) + P(01 \vert
%10) + %P(10 \vert 10) + P(00 \vert 11) + P(11 \vert 11) %\leq 3$, no?}

% Yes of course, sorry, I pasted the wrong one from my notebook... indeed the
% figure shows the one you wrote. (Davide)

\begin{multline}
 P(00\vert 00) + P(11 \vert 00) + P(00\vert 01) + P(11 \vert 01) + \\
 +P(01 \vert 10) + P(10 \vert 10) + P(00 \vert 11) + P(11 \vert 11) \leq 3
\label{eq:chsh_ineq}
\end{multline}

A well known generalization of the CHSH inequality are the so called CGLMP
\cite{cglmp} inequalities, which are defined for any Bell scenario with 2
settings for $X$ and $Y$ and $d$ outputs for $A$ and $B$, and can be written as:
\begin{gather}
    I_d^{\mathrm{CGLMP}} = \sum_{k=0}^{d-1} (d-1-k) S^d_k \le 3 (d-1)\\ \nonumber
    \text{where}\\
    \quad S^d_k = P(b+k,b|00) + P(a, a+k+1|10) +\\ \nonumber
    P(b+k, b | 11) +
    P(a, a+k | 01)
    \label{eq:GCLMP}
\end{gather}
where the sums $a+k, a+k+1$ and $b+k$ are modulo $d$.
Using the exclusivity graph method we can find that each of the $S^d_k$ is
classically constrained by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha(G^d_k) = 4$ if $k$ and $d$ satisfy $4k+1=nd$, for some
        integer $n$.
    \item $\alpha(G^d_k) = 3$ in the other cases.
\end{itemize}
Indeed the graphs $G^d_k$ relative to the $k$ all share the same structure:
%represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:gclmp_general},
there are four cliques, one for each setting $x,y \in {0,1}$, and any vertex in each clique is
connected to every other vertex in the adjacent clique, except for one.
For example $P(b+k,b|00)$ is connected to any node belonging to the $(0,1)$ and the
$(1,0)$ cliques, except for $P(a,a+k|01)$ and $P(a',a'+k+1|10)$ where $b+k = a$ and
$a'+k+1 = b$.
Clearly a maximal independent set cannot contain more than $4$ vertices (one for
each clique).
Moreover to be an independent set, a set of four nodes $\{P(b+k,b|00),
P(b'+k,b'|11), P(a,a+k|01), P(a',a;+k+1|01)\}$ must satisfy the conditions:
\begin{equation}
    \left\{
        \begin{aligned}
            &b + k = a \\
            &a + k = b' \\
            &b' + k = a' \\
            &a' + k + 1 = b 
        \end{aligned}
    \right.
    \label{eq:four_indipset_condition}
\end{equation}
where the sums are all modulo $d$.
From this follows directly that $4k+1 = 0$. 

To obtain the quantum bounds we can apply the NPA method as discussed above.
The results for some $S_k$ inequalities are shown in Table~\ref{tab:gclmps}.

    \label{tab:gclmps}
\end{table}
        
Interestingly, except for the case $(l,m,n) = (4,2,2)$, inequalities with the
same structure do not seem to arise in the instrumental case, which suggests
that the apparent similarity noticed in \cite{himbeeck2018} between the two scenarios, Bell and the
instrumental, only appears for specific number of inputs and outputs. 

%\section{Finding optimal instrumental inequalities}
%The presence of an odd cycle graph guarantees only that $\STAB(G) \subset
%\TH(G)$, but does not say anything on the %values of $\theta(G)$ and $\alpha(G)$.
%Nonetheless, if that condition is %satisfied there must be some optimal %choice of
%weights $w$ for which we can obtain a %maximum quantum violation.
%Formally if $n$ is the number of nodes of %$G$, we want to find the maximum:
%\begin{equation}
%    \max_{w \in [0,1]^n} \{\theta(G,w) - %\alpha(G,w)\}
%    \label{eq:maxonw}
%\end{equation}
%
%Using the definition \eqref{eq:lovasztheta} and \eqref{eq:alphastab}, and
%remembering that $\STAB(G)$ is a convex %hull of a finite number of
%characteristic labellings we can rewirte %the previous maximization as:
%\begin{align}
%    \Delta &= \min \{I_y : y \, \text{is a %maximal stable labelling}\}
%    \label{eq:maximize_w_delta}\\
%    I_y &= \max_{\substack{w \in %[0,1]^n\\x \in \TH(G)}} \{w\cdot (x - %y)\}
%    \label{eq:maximize_w_I}
%\end{align}
%
%The maximization \eqref{eq:maximize_w_I} %for each $y$ is efficient, being a
%semi-definite program, but unfortunately %it has to be run for each maximal
%stable set in $G$ which are $\sim 3^{n/3}$ %in the worst case.
%Also to enumerate all the maximal %independent sets we used the Tomita %version of
%the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm which has the %same worst case
%complexity\cite{tomita2006}.
%
\section{Discussion}
In this paper, we have proposed an unifying formalism to analyze classical and
quantum correlations arising in a broad class of causal structures. It is based
on a graph-theoretical formalism originally introduced in the field of quantum
information \cite{cabello2014,rabelo2014,acin2015}. In particular, we consider
the application of this formalism to analyze instrumental tests
\cite{pearl1995}. As we show, the probabilities arising in such experiments can
be encoded in a exclusivity graph and from there it follows that the classical
and quantum bounds respected by instrumental inequalities are related to two
graphs invariants: the independence number, $\alpha$, and Lov\'asz $\theta$,
respectively.

Apart from the fundamental relevance of bridging the fields of quantum
information and causal inference, our approach is also shown to be of practical
use. We not only rederived, in an easy manner, previous results in the literature,
we also manage to generalize them. For instance, we prove the inequalities
associated with an instrument assuming only two possible values do not have a
quantum violation (irrespectively of the number of outcomes), thus generalizing
the results in \cite{henson2014}. As well, we prove that if the number of
outcomes is fixed to two (the instrument now assuming any cardinality), there are no
other inequalities other than the original Bonet's inequality \cite{bonet2001} arising from a n-cycle graph. Following that, we have shown how new
instrumental inequalities associated with n-cycles of increasing n can be
obtained by increasing the possible values of both the instrument and the
outcomes.

The graph approach also constitutes a valuable tool to study similarities among
different scenarios and inspect whether, in the quantum realm, they could be
able to detect stronger forms of non-locality. For example, from the graph
perspective, the instrumental scenario and the well-known Bell scenario shows
similarities only for specific number of inputs/outputs. For example, the CHSH
scenario \cite{CHSH} and the $(l,m,n)=(4,2,2)$ instrumental scenario are graph
equivalent, however, this equivalence does not hold any longer when the outcome
variables assume an increasing number of possible values. Given the fundamental
importance of the instrumental scenario in causal inference and the increasing
attention it has been receiving in quantum information (particularly in
applications as randomness generation) we hope these results will strength the
connections between both fields and motivate further applications of the
graph-theoretical approach within causality.


 %Besides its practical usefulness, this approach constitutes a valuable tool to
 %study similarities among different scenarios and inspect whether, in the
 %quantum realm, they could be able to detect stronger forms of non-locality.
 %For example, from our analysis' results, the instrumental scenario and the
 %well-known Bell scenario shows similarities only for specific number of
 %inputs/outputs (for example, the CHSH scenario and the 422 instrumental
 %scenario are perfectly equivalent). This seems to indicate that, unlike
 %previous works suggested \cite{himbeeck2018}, the instrumental inequalities
 %might be able to reveal a different (and perhaps stronger) form of
 %non-locality, with respect to the Bell scenario.
