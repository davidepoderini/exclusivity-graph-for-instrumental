\section*{Building the exclusivity graph from DAG}
In the following we describe in more details how to get from the DAG
(Directed Acyclic Graph) representation of a causal model to the one
for exclusivity graph.
Starting from a generic causal model with $N$ random variables
$A_1,\ldots,A_N$ and $M$ instrument $X_1,\ldots,X_M$, represented by a
DAG $D=(V_D, E_D)$, the exclusivity graph $G = (V, E)$ can be constructed with the following algorithm:

\section*{Edge colored multigraph technique for approximating the quantum
bound}
\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption{Edge colored exclusivity graph representation of the Bonet
        inequality. Exclusivity constraints for the party $A$ and $B$ are
    represented by red lines and blue lines respectively.}
    \label{fig:instrumental_multigraph}
\end{figure}

The Lov\'asz theta of a graph, despite being efficiently computable,
only gives an upper bound to the maximal quantum bound, since it ignores
the additional constraints arising from the presence of different random
variables $A_i$.
Indeed the quantum bound is influenced not only by the exclusivity relations between the
possible events in our scenario, but also on how those relations are derived from the
variables $A_1,\ldots,A_N$.

To obtain a better approximation for the quantum bound we follow the technique presented in \cite{rabelo2014}. 
This method consists in introducing an edge coloring in the exclusivity graph. 
This edge coloring encodes the information of which of the $A_i$s is involved in the exclusivity constraints under consideration.
In practice this corresponds to constructing an exclusivity graph $G_i$ for each
$A_i$, the resulting object is called a \emph{multigraph}. 
Having defined a multigraph $G = {G_1, \ldots, G_N}$ for a given scenario the
quantum bound is defined by the quantity:
\begin{equation}
    \vartheta(G) = \max_{v} \sum_{i \in V} |v \cdot a^1_i \otimes \dots \otimes a^n_i|^2
    \label{eq:multigraph_lovazs}
\end{equation}
where $\{a^j_i\}$ is an orthonormal labelling for $G_j$ and $V$ is the set of vertices of $G$. This quantity, which can be seen as a generalization of the Lov\'asz theta, is in general not efficiently computable, but, as described in \cite{rabelo2014}, can be arbitrarily approximated by a hierarchy of semi-definite programs using the NPA method.

For example, in the case of the pentagon in the instrumental scenario we have two colors, and thus two graph $G_A$ and $G_B$, corresponding to variables $A$ and $B$ respectively, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:instrumental_multigraph}.
Applying the technique described above to this scenario yields a quantum
bound of $2.2071$, reproducing the known value for the quantum bound of the Bonet inequality given by $(3+\sqrt{2})/2$.

\section*{There are no quantum violation for instrumental scenarios with $l=2$
settings.}
Here we prove that no quantum violation is possible for instrumental scenario
with $l=2$ possible settings for the instrumental variable $X$.
This reduces to proving that there are no odd $n$-cycles nor $n$-anticycles as induced
subgraphs in the corresponding exclusivity graph, with $n\ge5$.
To see this we can notice that any such graph is composed by two cliques (see
for example Fig.~\ref{fig:2mn_nocycle_proof}), corresponding to the events with $x=0$ and
$x=1$.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{images/nocycles_proof.pdf}
    \caption{Exclusivity graph for the instrumental scenario $233$, showing the
        impossibility of having cycles with more than $5$ vertices. To simplify the figure cliques are
    represented by bold lines between vertices.}
    \label{fig:2mn_nocycle_proof}
\end{figure}
Any $n$-cycle with at least $5$ vertices must then have at least $3$ mutually
connected vertices belonging to the same $x$, so they can never form a
cycle-graph.
Similarly we can show that there cannot be any induced odd anticycle with $5$ or more
vertices.

\section*{There are no cycles $C_n$ with $n \ge 7$ in the $l22$ instrumental scenario.}
%\label{sec:c5only_proof}
In the following we prove that there cannot be a odd anticycle with more than
$5$ vertices in the exclusivity graph associated to an instrumental scenario of
the type $l22$.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\columnwidth]{images/cycle_proof.pdf}
    \caption{Proof of the impossibility of having cycles with $7$ nodes or more
    in the $d22$ scenario.}
    \label{fig:cycle_graph_proof}
\end{figure}

From the exclusivity conditions \eqref{eq:non_exclusivity_condition},
given two events $ab|x$ and $a'b'|x'$, they are connected by edge if one of these two conditions is true:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $x=x'$.\label{en:rule1}
    \item $a=a'$ and $b \neq b'$.\label{en:rule2}
\end{enumerate}
Suppose we have a cycle $C_n$ with $n \ge 7$, as in fig.~\ref{fig:cycle_graph_proof},
and consider that node $2$ in this graph corresponds to an event which we can arbitrarily identify as $00|0$.
Among its neighbors $1$ and $3$, one will necessarily need to satisfy rule
\ref{en:rule2} (they cannot both satisfy rule \ref{en:rule1} or the three nodes
would be a clique.
So without loss of generality we can assign the event $01|1$ to $3$.
Since nodes $5,6,7$ must not satisfy rule \ref{en:rule2} with both $2$ and $3$, then they must have $a = 1$.
Moreover $7$ and $5$ must have the same $b$, different from $6$. In the same way $1$ must not satisfy rule \ref{en:rule2} with $6,5$ and $3$, so it
needs to have $a=0$ and $b=1$. At this point, since we only have values
$\{0,1\}$ for $a$, we cannot avoid node $4$ to be linked to one of the nodes
$1,2,6,7$. Thus, the corresponding graph cannot be a cycle.
